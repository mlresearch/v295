title: 'Game-Theoretic Optimisation of EV Charging Network: Placement and Pricing
  Strategies via Atomic Congestion Game'
abstract: "The “chicken-and-egg problem”  in Electric Vehicle (EV) charging reflects
  the interdependence between sufficient \r infrastructure and the demand needed to
  justify it, a challenge heightened by the UK’s 2030 ban on new combustion engine
  vehicles. \r To address this, we propose a joint optimisation model that determines
  the optimal number of charging points and pricing at each station, \r while accounting
  for traffic patterns. From a policy perspective, our model seeks to maximise public
  benefit by reducing EV users’ social \r costs, travel and queuing time, and charging
  fees, while ensuring station operator profitability. We model driver decisions as
  two \r interconnected congestion games, one on roads and one at charging stations
  (CS), and solve for stable outcomes using Nash Equilibrium (NE) \r strategies. To
  ensure tractability, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm for the Mixed-Integer
  Nonlinear Program (MINLP) and \r introduce a generalisation technique that targets
  charger placement at high-impact locations, enhancing scalability to larger Transportation
  \r Networks (TN). Applied to a benchmark case, the model reduces overall social
  cost by at least 14% compared to methods that optimise \r placement or pricing alone.
  This study tackles an AI challenge in modelling infrastructure with multi-agent
  behaviour, using game theory \r and optimisation to simulate interactions and enable
  learning-based approaches in transportation systems.\r "
