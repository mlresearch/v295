title: Enhancing Uncertainty Estimation with Deep Gaussian Processes
abstract: "Accurately estimating uncertainty in predictive models is crucial for a
  wide range of applications, \r from decision-making in landuse modelling to robust
  forecasting in finance and autonomous systems. \r Gaussian processes (GPs) offer
  a solid framework for uncertainty quantification but often struggle with scalability
  \r and flexibility when applied to large, high-dimensional datasets. Deep Gaussian
  processes (DGPs) are a powerful \r extension of GPs that allow for multi-layer generalisation
  of GPs, enabling more flexible and expressive modelling of \r complex data. As the
  complexity of the model increases, so does the computational cost, which makes it
  difficult to \r scale DGP to large-dimensional data. Although variational inference
  has been used with large datasets, it often produces \r an overconfident uncertainty
  estimate because it does not effectively utilise input-dependent function uncertainty.
  \r This paper introduces an approach for enhancing uncertainty estimation using
  the predictive log-likelihood (PLL) objective \r with DGP model to address these
  limitations. This relies on a parametric GP regression model designed for a family
  of \r predictive distributions and incorporate a modified objective function to
  restore a full symmetry between various \r contributions to predictive variance.
  We evaluate the performance of our methods on several benchmark regressions and
  \r large-scale environmental datasets. The results show that the model provides
  more reliable uncertainty estimates, particularly \r in regions of sparse data,
  making them efficient for real-world applications.\r "
