title: 'AI in the Public Eye: Analysing Social Media Sentiment and Opinion on Artificial
  Intelligence'
abstract: "Artificial Intelligence (AI), a rapidly evolving technology with far-reaching
  implications, has become a \r widely discussed topic on social media platforms.
  This study conducted a comprehensive sentiment analysis of posts \r discussing AI
  topics on Twitter, YouTube and Reddit from 2017 to 2024 to evaluate public perceptions
  and attitudes toward AI. \r A total of 133,004 social media posts were analysed
  using a fine-tuned RoBERTa model for sentiment classification, alongside \r Latent
  Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), n-gram, and word co-occurrence mapping for topic modelling.
  The analysis revealed that \r 46.09% of the posts express negative sentiments about
  AI, followed by 39.29% neutral and 14.62% positive sentiments. \r LDA uncovered
  20 key topics, including AI ethics, job impacts, and philosophical implications.
  Temporal analysis revealed a \r significant surge in AI-related discourse from 2022
  onward, with evolving sentiment patterns. These findings suggest a complex \r landscape
  of public AI perception, reflecting persistent concerns about societal impacts alongside
  increasing interest in AIâ€™s \r technical aspects.\r "
