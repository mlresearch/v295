title: 'Cat Royale: A Case Study of Artist-led AI Research'
abstract: "We explore artist-led research as a method to complement technical AI methodologies.
  We present a case study \r called Cat Royale in which artists created a robot to
  play with cats. We show how the artist-led development of this system \r involved
  extensive improvisation to create a socio-technical AI system that ultimately delivered
  a corpus of video data of cats \r interacting with robots. We introduce a machine
  learning tool that enables diverse stakeholders to explore this corpus. We reflect
  \r on the distinctive characteristics of artist-led AI research, the potential benefits
  to AI, and the tensions involved.\r "
